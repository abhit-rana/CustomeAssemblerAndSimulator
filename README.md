## Introduction

Implementing a custom assembler and simulator for the given Instruction Set Architecture(ISA). A Scatter Plot is also plotted with the cycle number on the x-axis and the memory address on the y-axis depicting which memory address is accessed at what time.

## Demo

* Assembler


* Simulator


* Scatter Plot



## Instructions to run the Assembler and Simulator
