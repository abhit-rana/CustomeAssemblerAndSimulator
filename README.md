## Introduction

Implementing a custom assembler and simulator for the given Instruction Set Architecture(ISA). Information regarding the ISA could be found [here](https://github.com/abhit-rana/Toucan/blob/main/ISA-DESCRIPTION.pdf). The information regarding the working of Assembler and Simulator is available [here](https://github.com/abhit-rana/Toucan/blob/main/Porject_Components_Description.pdf).
A Scatter Plot is also plotted with the cycle number on the x-axis and the memory address on the y-axis depicting which memory address is accessed at what time.
